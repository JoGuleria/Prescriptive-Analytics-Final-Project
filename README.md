This project develops a prescriptive model to guide Skyline Capital Partners’ real estate investment in Class B apartments across three markets.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Select the best market and optimal unit mix (Studio & 1-Bedroom) to maximize profit while assessing risk under uncertainty.

## 🧠 Methodology
- **Market Selection**: Compared Fairview, New Hope, and Springfield using KPIs (NOI, Rent Growth, Equity Growth, Expense Ratio, Vacancy Rate).
- **Optimization Model**: Applied Linear Programming in Python to maximize profit with constraints on space, units, and market demand.
- **Risk Analysis**: Ran Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 runs) to model rent and vacancy variability.

## 🏆 Key Results
- **Best Market**: New Hope (Highest NOI, Equity Growth, and Rent Growth)
- **Optimal Unit Mix**: 48 Studios + 35 1-Bedrooms
- **Projected Profit**: $926,000 annually
- **Resilience**: Profitable in 85% of simulated scenarios

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (PuLP, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Gamma AI for deck formatting
- ChatGPT for simulation logic and write-up assistance
